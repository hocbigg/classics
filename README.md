## How to use this curriculum

### Core

Everyone should complete the following sections in sequence to gain a coherent foundation in the discipline:

1. I. Orientation to Classical Studies  
   Start here. This gives you the basic context and shows how knowledge of the ancient world is constructed.

2. II. The Ancient Mediterranean World  
   Build your historical and geographical framework. Work through the historical overviews and become comfortable using maps of the ancient world.

3. III. Languages of the Classical World  
   Learn at least one of the two languages (Latin or Ancient Greek) to an intermediate reading level.  
   - Choose one language to focus on seriously (most people begin with Latin because resources are slightly more beginner-friendly).  
   - Use the other language only as a supplement later, if time and interest allow.

4. IV. Classical Literature  
   Read major works in the language you chose. This is the heart of Classics: direct engagement with the primary texts that have shaped Western thought.

After finishing these four core sections, you will have the essential knowledge and skills of an undergraduate Classics major: historical context, geographical awareness, working knowledge of one classical language, and firsthand experience reading the major authors.

### Specialization Tracks

The remaining sections are deeper or more specialized. You do not need to study all of them. Pick according to your interests after you have finished (or are very far along in) the Core:

- V. Religion, Myth, and Society: Good if you are drawn to ancient beliefs, rituals, social structures, or gender roles.
- VI. Philosophy & Science: Choose this track if you are especially interested in ancient thought, logic, ethics, or the history of science/medicine.
- VII. Material Culture & Evidence: Ideal if you love archaeology, art, architecture, visual culture, or physical evidence (coins, inscriptions, ruins).
- VIII. Methods of Classical Scholarship: For those who want to understand how classicists read, edit, and interpret texts at a professional level.
- IX. Late Antiquity & Transformation: If you are curious about the transition from classical antiquity to the early medieval/Christian world.
- X. Reception of Classics: Perfect if you enjoy seeing how ancient ideas, stories, and images have been reused in later literature, art, film, and modern culture.
