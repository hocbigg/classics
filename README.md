# Summary

The Classics curriculum is a complete education in Classics using online materials.

## Organization

This repository is organized into three main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;
- **[Projects](projects.md)**: support learning through practical application throughout the curriculum.

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Practical work is integrated through the [Projects section](projects.md) and may be undertaken alongside coursework.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core

Everyone should complete the following sections in sequence to gain a coherent foundation in the discipline:

1. I. Orientation to Classical Studies  
   Start here. This gives the basic context and shows how knowledge of the ancient world is constructed.

2. II. The Ancient Mediterranean World  
   Build your historical and geographical framework. Work through the historical overviews and become comfortable using maps of the ancient world.

3. III. Languages of the Classical World  
   Learn at least one of the two languages (Latin or Ancient Greek) to an intermediate reading level.  
   - Choose one language to focus on seriously (most people begin with Latin because resources are slightly more beginner-friendly).  
   - Use the other language only as a supplement later, if time and interest allow.

4. IV. Classical Literature  
   Read major works in the language you chose. This is the heart of Classics: direct engagement with the primary texts that have shaped Western thought.

After finishing these four core sections, you will have the essential knowledge and skills of an undergraduate Classics major (before moving to [Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)): historical context, geographical awareness, working knowledge of one classical language, and firsthand experience reading the major authors.
