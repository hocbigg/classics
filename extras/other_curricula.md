# Other curricula

This curriculum is one of a few efforts to inform learners how they can pursue Classics independently. Below are a few other such efforts.

- [Textkit Self-Study Guide for Latin and Greek](https://www.textkit.com/learn.php) (Community-driven guides and textbooks for languages)
- [Stoa Consortium: Ancient Studies Curricula](https://www.stoa.org/) (Collaborative open-access projects for self-study in classics)
