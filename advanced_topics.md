The remaining sections are deeper or more specialized. You do not need to study all of them. Pick according to your interests after you have finished (or are very far along in) the Core:

- V. Religion, Myth, and Society: Good if you are drawn to ancient beliefs, rituals, social structures, or gender roles.
- VI. Philosophy & Science: Choose this track if you are especially interested in ancient thought, logic, ethics, or the history of science/medicine.
- VII. Material Culture & Evidence: Ideal if you love archaeology, art, architecture, visual culture, or physical evidence (coins, inscriptions, ruins).
- VIII. Methods of Classical Scholarship: For those who want to understand how classicists read, edit, and interpret texts at a professional level.
- IX. Late Antiquity & Transformation: If you are curious about the transition from classical antiquity to the early medieval/Christian world.
- X. Reception of Classics: Perfect if you enjoy seeing how ancient ideas, stories, and images have been reused in later literature, art, film, and modern culture.
